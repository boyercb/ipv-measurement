# Abstract

Over the last decade, the number of randomized trials of programs to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV) has grown precipitously. However, most trials continue to measure and code violence using standards originally designed for global prevalence surveys. This choice may have consequences in terms of bias, power, and efficiency of trial estimates and may limit what we can learn about how programs are working. In this paper, we return to first principles to develop a generative model for violence reduction. We then use this model to better understand trade-offs in outcome coding choices via simulation. We re-analyze results from recent trials to highlight some of our findings. We conclude with a discussion of key take-aways for trialists.
